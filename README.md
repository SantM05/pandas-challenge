###### Code to calculate the data by separate grade: ninth_graders = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["grade"] == "9th")]
###### tenth_graders = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["grade"] == "10th")]
###### eleventh_graders = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["grade"] == "11th")]
###### twelfth_graders = school_data_complete[(school_data_complete["grade"] == "12th")]
